            <h1>AI and advanced analytics</h1>
            <p>Uncover insights and power your data with AI to make smarter decisions, reimagine customer experiences, and transform your enterprise.</p>
            <p>Businesses are using AI now more than ever before. From banks training AI to empower their digital workforce to telecommunication companies setting up smart chat bots to transform customer service, AI is being scaled across industries at an
                enterprise level. By collecting and learning from data, cognitive systems can spot trends and provide insights to help your teams improve workflows, response times and customer experiences. With smart AI, you're able to bring your business
                into the 21st century and beyond.</p>
            <h1>Confronting data issues and bridging the artificial intelligence (AI) skills gap to the enterprise</h1>
            <p>Enterprise-wide AI has the potential to bring exponential competitive advantage to companies that adopt the technology. But many businesses struggle as they move from AI experimentation to implementation. Some, however, are successfully achieving
                AI at scale. They're disproportionately financial outperformers and their experiences offer valuable lessons for organizations looking to adopt AI.</p>
            <p>To gain their insight, we partnered surveyed C-level executives and top functional leaders about AI and cognitive computing. AI have evolved in four key areas:</p>
            <ul style="transform:translate(3%, 0);">
                <li>Companies have a sharper focus on AI. Ninety-three percent of outperformers* are at least considering AI adoption.</li>
                <li>They are also placing more emphasis on topline growth. Seventy-seven percent of outperformers now cite customer satisfaction as a key value driver for AI.</li>
                <li>Data is becoming increasingly important. Eighty-six percent of outperformers now have enterprise-wide data governance.</li>
                <li>Skills are becoming an even bigger concern. Sixty-three percent of all respondents now see skills as a top barrier to achieving success in AI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Companies can get started on their own successful AI implementation by following four high-level tactics for a successful shift to AI.</p>
            <p>Outperformers are those organizations that self-identify as having outperformed their peers on revenue growth and profitability for private sector organizations, or revenue growth and effectiveness at achieving objectives for public sector
                organizations.

            <h1>Access Control & Surveillance Systems</h1>
            <p>When a credential is presented to a reader, the reader sends the credential's information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential's number to an access control list, grants
                or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a database. When access is denied based on the access control list, the door remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the access control list, the control
                panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks the door. The control panel also ignores a door open signal to prevent an alarm. Often the reader provides feedback, such as a flashing red LED for an access denied and a flashing green LED for
                an access granted.</p>
            <p>The above description illustrates a single factor transaction. Credentials can be passed around, thus subverting the access control list. For example, Alice has access rights to the server room, but Bob does not. Alice either gives Bob her
                credential, or Bob takes it; he now has access to the server room. To prevent this, two-factor authentication can be used. In a two factor transaction, the presented credential and a second factor are needed for access to be granted; another
                factor can be a PIN, a second credential, operator intervention, or a biometric input.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="section12">
        <div class="regular-right">
            <h1>There are three types (factors) of authenticating information:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>something the user knows, e.g. a password, pass-phrase or PIN</li>
                <li>something the user has, such as smart card or a key fob</li>
                <li>something the user is, such as fingerprint, verified by biometric measurement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Passwords are a common means of verifying a user's identity before access is given to information systems. In addition, a fourth factor of authentication is now recognized: someone you know, whereby another person who knows you can provide
                a human element of authentication in situations where systems have been set up to allow for such scenarios. For example, a user may have their password, but have forgotten their smart card. In such a scenario, if the user is known to designated
                cohorts, the cohorts may provide their smart card and password, in combination with the extant factor of the user in question, and thus provide two factors for the user with the missing credential, giving three factors overall to allow
                access.

    <div id="section14">
        <div class="regular-left">
            <h1>Credential</h1>
            <p>A credential is a physical/tangible object, a piece of knowledge, or a facet of a person's physical being that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system. Typically, credentials can be something
                a person knows (such as a number or PIN), something they have (such as an access badge), something they are (such as a biometric feature), or some combination of these items. This is known as multi-factor authentication. The typical credential
                is an access card or key-fob, and newer software can also turn users' smartphones into access devices.</p>
            <p>There are many card technologies including magnetic stripe, bar code, Wiegand, 125 kHz proximity, 26-bit card-swipe, contact smart cards, and contactless smart cards. Also available are key-fobs, which are more compact than ID cards, and attach
                to a key ring. Biometric technologies include fingerprint, facial recognition, iris recognition, retinal scan, voice, and hand geometry. The built-in biometric technologies found on newer smartphones can also be used as credentials in
                conjunction with access software running on mobile devices. In addition to older more traditional card access technologies, newer technologies such as Near field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth low energy can also communicate user credentials
                to readers for system or building access.</p>

        <div class="regular-right">
            <h1>Access control topology</h1>
            <p>Access control decisions are made by comparing the credential to an access control list. This look-up can be done by a host or server, by an access control panel, or by a reader. The development of access control systems has seen a steady
                push of the look-up out from a central host to the edge of the system, or the reader. The predominant topology circa 2009 is hub and spoke with a control panel as the hub, and the readers as the spokes. The look-up and control functions
                are by the control panel. The spokes communicate through a serial connection; usually RS-485. Some manufactures are pushing the decision making to the edge by placing a controller at the door. The controllers are IP enabled, and connect
                to a host and database using standard networks</p>

            <ul style="transform:translate(3%, 0);">
                <li>RS-485 standard allows long cable runs, up to 4000 feet (1200 m)</li>
                <li>Relatively short response time. The maximum number of devices on an RS-485 line is limited to 32, which means that the host can frequently request status updates from each device, and display events almost in real time.</li>
                <li>High reliability and security as the communication line is not shared with any other systems.</li>
            </ul>

    <div id="section17">
        <div class="regular-right">
            <h1>Security risks</h1>
            <p>The most common security risk of intrusion through an access control system is by simply following a legitimate user through a door, and this is referred to as tailgating. Often the legitimate user will hold the door for the intruder. This
                risk can be minimized through security awareness training of the user population or more active means such as turnstiles. In very high-security applications this risk is minimized by using a sally port, sometimes called a security vestibule
                or mantrap, where operator intervention is required presumably to assure valid identification.</p>
            <p>The third most common security risk is natural disasters. In order to mitigate risk from natural disasters, the structure of the building, down to the quality of the network and computer equipment vital. From an organizational perspective,
                the leadership will need to adopt and implement an All Hazards Plan, or Incident Response Plan. The highlights of any incident plan determined by the National Incident Management System must include Pre-incident planning, during incident
                actions, disaster recovery, and after-action review.</p>
            <p>Similar to levering is crashing through cheap partition walls. In shared tenant spaces, the divisional wall is a vulnerability. A vulnerability along the same lines is the breaking of sidelights.</p>
            <p>Spoofing locking hardware is fairly simple and more elegant than levering. A strong magnet can operate the solenoid controlling bolts in electric locking hardware. Motor locks, more prevalent in Europe than in the US, are also susceptible
                to this attack using a doughnut-shaped magnet. It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost
                always located on the secure side of the door.</p>
            <p>Access cards themselves have proven vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Enterprising hackers have built portable readers that capture the card number from a user's proximity card. The hacker simply walks by the user, reads the card, and then
                presents the number to a reader securing the door. This is possible because card numbers are sent in the clear, no encryption being used. To counter this, dual authentication methods, such as a card plus a PIN should always be used.</p>
            <p>Many access control credentials unique serial numbers are programmed in sequential order during manufacturing. Known as a sequential attack, if an intruder has a credential once used in the system they can simply increment or decrement the
                serial number until they find a credential that is currently authorized in the system. Ordering credentials with random unique serial numbers is recommended to counter this threat.</p>
            <p>Finally, most electric locking hardware still has mechanical keys as a fail-over. Mechanical key locks are vulnerable to bumping.</p>

            <h1>Computer security</h1>
            <p>In computer security, general access control includes authentication, authorization, and audit. A narrower definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system makes a decision to grant or reject an access request
                from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based
                on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric analysis, physical keys, electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.</p>
            <p>In any access-control model, the entities that can perform actions on the system are called subjects, and the entities representing resources to which access may need to be controlled are called objects (see also Access Control Matrix). Subjects
                and objects should both be considered as software entities, rather than as human users: any human users can only have an effect on the system via the software entities that they control.</p>
            <p>Although some systems equate subjects with user IDs, so that all processes started by a user by default have the same authority, this level of control is not fine-grained enough to satisfy the principle of least privilege, and arguably is
                responsible for the prevalence of malware in such systems (see computer insecurity).</p>
            <p>In some models, for example the object-capability model, any software entity can potentially act as both subject and object.</p>
            <p>As of 2014, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on capabilities and those based on access control lists (ACLs).</p>
            <ul style="transform:translate(3%, 0);">
                <li>In a capability-based model, holding an unforgeable reference or capability to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one's house key grants one access to one's house); access is conveyed to another
                    party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel</li>
                <li>In an ACL-based model, a subject's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the
                    guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list. (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited).</li>
